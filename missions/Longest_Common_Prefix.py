# This function should take an list of strings and 
# determine the longest common prefix among all the strings. 
# If there is no common prefix, it should return an empty string.

# example
# Input: List of strings (str).
# Output: String (str).

# Examples:
assert longest_prefix(["flower", "flow", "flight"]) == "fl"
assert longest_prefix(["dog", "racecar", "car"]) == ""
assert longest_prefix(["apple", "application", "appetizer"]) == "app"
assert longest_prefix(["a"]) == "a"

# How itâ€™s used:

# -    in autocomplete systems to suggest the most likely completion;
# -    in file systems to suggest directory names based on current input;
# -   in DNA sequence alignment to identify common substrings.
